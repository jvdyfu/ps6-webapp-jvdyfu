Description

Purpose: Police brutality against marginalized communities (BIPOC, LGBTQIA+)
has sparked discussions on (de)funding, (de)militarization, and the 
role of police in society. The Use of Force policy, implemented on 
4/15/2021, aims to ensure impartial policing, accountability, and 
constant evaluation. We believe that new data on policing patterns
can inform this ongoing discourse and shape our opinions.

Source: The data comes a reliable source from the City of Seattle's open portal 
(data.seattle.gov) where the data is published by city departments.
The city department we decided to look in is the Seattle Police 
Department with a focus on the use of force policy.

Panels

Introduction: Opening page containing details on the purpose and source of our data.

Race Bar Plot Panel: A race bar plot that attempts to answer the 
question of whether or not there is a correlation
between race and the number of police cases where force was used. 
The data depicts data on the number of cases by race of the victims.
The first widget allows you to choose the races you want to view side by side with other
bar charts of other races. The second widget is a visual widget that allows you to 
change the color of the bar plot. 

Gender Table Panel: A gender table panel that attempts to answer the 
question of whether or not there is a correlation
between gender and the number of police cases
where force was used. We also can answer the 
question of if there's a correlation with the 
level of force used (incident type). The data depicts data on the number of
cases by the gender identity of the victims.
The widget allows you to view the cases by the level of use of force used on the victims.
